                    <p>I'm a Game Designer & Programmer based in NYC who primarily works in Unity. I am currently studying at CUNY BA under City College's Gaming Pathways Department and Hunter's Comp-Sci Department. I've gained much of my development experience from EGD's Game Studio Program and have held internships at Most Dangerous Games & IndieCade.</p>
                    <p>I've worked on numerous projects of varying lengths and team sizes, from solo-projects & small teams to 100-student mock studios. I'm comfortable in both leading and supporting roles.</p>
                    <p>I love creating elegant experiences that are accessible and easy to pick-up, but hold enough complexity to keep things engaging. Adding juice and ending with a polished product is very important to me.</p>

            <p>A 2D platformer where you control a crumpled ball of paper that can transform into different origami shapes, each with different abilities!</p>
            
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>This was made as part of EGD's Exploration Program with a small team of me and three others. We were prepared to work together on a larger project after becoming comfortable with each other with a few tinier games for the first semester.</p>

            <p>I've often enjoyed crafting paper cranes to keep my hands busy. I picked this back up early into my second semester and suggested the idea to my team: a game in which the player controls a crumpled paper ball that can shift into origami shapes, each with different properties.</p>

            <p>We ran with the idea, making it a simple platformer made in GameMaker with art themed around stationery. I recall we spent a good amount of time trying to contextualize the narrative for the game and making that work, though we eventually realized that for a game like this, it didn't really matter. When people think of origami, they think of playful arts and crafts, so we themed everything around just that and kept the narrative to a minimum.</p>

            <p>I was in charge of handling the level design & audio. The SFX was simple and fun to make; I crumpled some paper and tore it next to my mic for all those sounds. Music took a bit longer; I had never composed a song before, so taking what I learned in Music Theory 101 and putting it into practice was a bit daunting, but I'm happy with how the track turned out.</p>

            <p>In terms of Level Design, I quickly learned how difficult it is to create a tutorial level. Earlier iterations were way too hard and challenged playtesters too much when we presented them at CCNY's Unreleased Games Arcade. Eventually, I managed to get the tutorial to a point where I liked it, and while the latter half of the game was far less polished, I was content with my output.</p>
            
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>We presented Refold at Waffle Games 6.0. While I was happy with how it turned out, I was still shocked at how positively people reacted when they played the game. While I initially wondered why people were getting excited over a simple platformer with a slight twist, I eventually realized that the theme's cohesion is what really sold the experience. Mechanically, the game is nothing crazy, but the cute origami/stationery theming meshed with it well.</p>

            <p>The game ended up winning EGD's "Best Overall GSP Game" for that school year and is now regularly shown at EGD and Urban Arts tabling events as an example of what students can make. Had I known it would still be shown to this day, I would've done much more polish on the level design, but at least now I try to value that polish far more.</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>This game was developed by me and six others as part of a two-day game jam in partnership with EGD and SGDA, with the theme "Bees!"</p>

                <p>We had the evening to meet and plan our idea, with a full Saturday to get it done. During our evening meeting, we brainstormed ideas, and I explained my vision for the high-score game we ended with, using a poorly drawn MS-Paint image to convey my idea. The team liked the plan, and I got to work making a game design summary and a task list for every team member to complete during that Saturday.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the game jam was announced after I was already scheduled to work on the day of the jam, so I couldn't help much in creating the game. However, I was still regularly checking in and offering design advice when needed. By the time I got home, my team had pulled through, and we had a fully finished project!</p>
                
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Given our time constraints, my team and I were happy with how the project turned out! This was one of my first real game jams, and it was a very cool experience to have something be an idea one evening and a playable game the next!</p>

                <p>We received quite favorable reviews for the jam, placing fifth in Gameplay, fourth Overall, second in Audio, and first in Usability/Accessibility!</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>I and six others made this in EGD for a two-week unthemed game jam. This was my first ever experience as a sole programmer for a project, so it was interesting to get my bearings with Unity. Shortly before this, I started to ideate the basis of a solo game I wanted to make, "Balldyseus." I expressed my curiosity about that movement mechanic, and we decided to "roll" with it!</p>

                <p>Since this year's Aspen game was in 3D, we thought it'd be best to pursue that for this game. We had some animal assets on hand, so we decided to theme the game around an Opossum escaping a pet store in a hamster ball while collecting food pellets!</p>

                <p>Programming went fairly smoothly. After the basic movement and pellet collection were done, the main challenge was figuring out how to cut out unique shapes for the level design in the game. Afterward, the designers and I built the level, decorated it, added our Title Screen and Game-Over screen, and we had a finished product.</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>For a 2-week jam as my first real programming experience, while we were all juggling school, I think the game turned out quite well. The movement was awkward; a game like this probably would have benefitted from a trackball, which was obviously not achievable for a web-based game like this. Past that, we should have found some actual models for the food pellets since it's unclear what the squares you're collecting are, and generally, we could have added far more polish and feedback. But past that, I'm happy with the outcome.</p>

                <p>I and three others made this in EGD for an unthemed game jam. To further test the movement mechanics I was aiming to achieve for "Balldyseus," I decided to reuse the concept found in Opossum Ops and attempt to refine it for a 2D space.</p>

                <p>Initially, this was meant to actually be Balldyseus, but due to time constraints and a realization we could not create the systems we needed for that game in a month, we scaled the game back massively in the last week and made it smaller high-score based game themed around catching chickens before they escaped.</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Although it was initially moreso a test for me, every team member really pulled through with their part and we ended up with a very cute and cohesive gamejam! Of course there's definitely things I would change about this now, particularly in terms of the UI and feedback, but I'm proud of how this turned out!</p>

                <p>The King's financial committee has declared that, due to budget-cuts, only one Jester will be able to keep their job! As such, each Jester will take turns doing an Impromptu Performance for the King!</p>
            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>This was one of my first in-person jams! I worked with four others whom I knew from EGD. We attended the opening ceremony on Friday evening and got to brainstorming the overall concept.</p>

                <p>Since I was the lead programmer and still not fully comfortable with Unity, I thought it'd be best to have a game that leaned more into real-life interaction with others rather than being heavy on the game-mechanics, something akin to a Jackbox party game. With the theme being "Make Me Laugh", we decided to take this as literally as possible. One player is the king, the rest are jesters who must take turns "making them laugh," whoever does that the best wins! With the twist being that while doing their "performance", the King can at any time press X, Y, or B on their controller to spawn a person, place, or thing that the jester must incorporate into their performance.</p>

                <p>The next day was pure work, I arrived at the center and got the main systems down. Artists made art, musicians made music. I spent that full night working on the game nonstop, which marks my first time pulling an all-nighter for a project! That Sunday, We wrapped up the game & submitted it!</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>For the rest of the Sunday, we presented our game alongside all the others. People responded extremely positively to the concept! Many had a lot of fun playing with their friends and making each other laugh, with many playing multiple rounds in a row!</p>

                <p>When the time came for the awards, we weren't exactly expecting anything since our game was relatively unpolished compared to many others in the jam, but we ended up winning the "Best Use of Theme" award! We were super ecstatic about that!</p>

I assisted in the ideation of several of the core game mechanics, helped ideate some of the enemy types, helped create the audio manager and all its implementations, and I created a few of the game mechanics, primarily involving the game's rotating slash wall.</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Due to a variety of reasons, the game did not come anywhere near what we were hoping for. The game's scope was simply too large for the students, and we did not get enough iterative loops or playtesting in to address simple game design issues that caused developers to waste their time (such as our needless focus on combat and enemy creation, when the most fun part of the game was the platforming).</p>

                <p>Despite the turnout of the project, the most important thing was that all the students learned what it's like working in a massive team like this, so at least that aspect of the game was a success!</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>A game developed as part of IndieCade's Summer Climate Internship! Where I got to develop a climate-themed jam under the guidance of IndieCade mentors!</p>

                <p>You play as Cornboy on his quest to destroy a forest so he can grow cash crops and make a profit! Though the environment is not going to give up without a fight! Dodge attacks and plant your corn seeds to take over this land!</p>

            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>The development went relatively smoothly. I knew I wanted to theme the game about taking over the land with corn with some over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek tone. With this I knew I wanted some kind of area control mechanic, so I decided to take a .io game I played long ago called Paper.io, and convert its core mechanic to a bullet hell type game.</p>

                <p>I got my friend Kaya to join the jam, he's been interested in starting game development and thought this would be a good opportunity for him to get started with Unity. He ideated the attacks & handled the foundation for the game, creating the player with health & movement along with the basis for attacks that can damage and kill the player, as well as implementing UI & the pause menu + title screen.</p>

                <p>Once we had the foundation, I moved into the main developer seat to handle the harder tasks, particularly the attack-patterns and the cornfield mechanic. The paper.io-like cornfield creation was a challenge to implement, and after finally getting it to work, we realized it's not all too fun in a bullet-hell setting, so we chose to scrap the whole thing and change the game so that cornboy draws the cornfields like a paint brush.</p>

                <p>I created all the art, which was a fun and interesting experience as I had never taken on a leading art role in a project up until this point. Kaya handled the audio, I added a lot of juice into the UI and interactions using the FEEL Unity asset as a huge aid, and we had a pretty polished game by the end of it!</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Via group vote amongst participants in the production sprint, with 48 entries, the game managed to hit the top-10 amongst all but one category, notably reaching #2 for gameplay and #7 overall.</p>

                <p>I'm very happy with the outcome, it may be a smaller game compared to others in the jam, but it felt great to have something that I was in complete control of, and able to show and prove to myself that I can see a creative vision through to its end.</p>

                <p>Experience the epic rap battle between the famous Dr. Rap against water! (like, the concept of water itself!)</p>
            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>This one was… interesting. Definitely more of a "comedic experience" than a game. After completing Cornboy, I was set to join this 2-day water-themed game jam with a small team for the EGD Summer Program. I was tired of unity development from my previous jam and wanted to make something simple, but still entertaining, polished, and visually interesting.</p>

                <p>While commuting there, I was struck with a flash of inspiration. "What if it was a rap battle, AGAINST THE VERY CONCEPT OF WATER!!!" Perhaps the success of Cornboy had inflated my hubris, I no longer held the bearings of whether I *should* see my vision completed, but only if i *could.*</p>

                <p>I pitched the idea to my team, we all found it funny, and we got to work. Since the secondary theme was "healing", we added a doctor to our game. "Dr. Rap"! Our sound designer Zahir volunteered to be Dr. Rap, so we took pictures of him and pixelated him to a Mortal Kombat-esque visual style. Our whole visual style was mis-mashed and not cohesive, but strangely that seemed to work for how ridiculous our game was.</p>

                <p>Gameplaywise, we purposely wanted there to be no real strategy. The player must pick a vague option on what they want to rap about and they have no clue which one is correct or incorrect. In a normal game this level of randomness and uncertainty for the player would not be acceptable, but since the winning or losing isn't a particularly important part of the experience, I don't think it matters much here.</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>"What have I just played?",  "off the rails",  "LMAO"</p>

                <p>These were all comment sentiments from the comments of the Jam submission, which is precisely what I was hoping for. The game was weird, random, and certainly wasn't winning any gameplay awards, but it was what I wanted it to be, a comedic, entertaining experience.</p>

                <p>In the ratings, out of 84 entries, the game managed to reach #11 in Enjoyment and #29 Overall.</p>

                <p>When it's too hard to move your body and wake up, you must exit your body and force it to get up!</p>
            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>Following up on "Against The Tide," my team now had one month to complete a mental-health-themed game.</p>

                <p>Our initial concept was to try and create a top-down Zelda-esque game where you play as a person struggling with some neurodivergence portrayed by them being incredibly tiny. With their state, they must go through everyday tasks like getting out of bed or washing the dishes, which would be easy for an average person but incredibly hard for our main character.</p>

                <p>After a week of trying to make this work, we unfortunately realized that a concept like that would not be achievable in the time allotted. The dungeon design for a person's home was too awkward to contextualize, the art assets needed would be too significant, and since I was the sole programmer simultaneously juggling my summer internship & moving with this jam, we had to scale things back greatly.</p>

                <p>We decided to make things more of a rage-type game, akin to Getting Over It or Jump King, as me and our other designer Zahir are quite fond of those. When Ideating the movement, we suddenly thought of Ness' Up-B from the Super Smash Bros. Series, and we inspired our movement off of that, except altering the movement to be controlled with a mouse. To contextualize the game in a mental-health format, we wanted to have the main character struggling to get their body to move and wake up in a bout of depression, so the character must exit their body and force the body to move using their will.</p>

                <p>Due to my moving and other external factors, we had to put off most development until the last week, but we managed to get a solid experience done by the end!</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The gameplay itself turned out well. The movement was nice, the wall-bouncing got right where we wanted it, and the level design was a progressive challenge.</p>

                <p>Due to the time constraints, we had to abstract the visuals to simply being a blob and a basic environment, so the Mental Health theme is not really there, which is unfortunate. Newcomers are also often confused by the movement, so I wish I could have better visualized the "hitting" aspect of it in the tutorial. But past that, people who play through the game often get the rage-fueled determination I frequently see with rage games, but they still find the challenge fair and achievable. So, my main goal of creating a solid rage game was a success!</p>

                <p>Power On your old "Decay & Watch" system to blast through a horde of decaying zombies and get a high score!</p>
            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>After wrapping up "Pick Yourself Up," we capped off the EGD Summer Game Jams with a 2-day Decay-themed jam!</p>

                <p>To do something small and achievable while still making a cool experience for the jam, we decided to make a homage to old Game & Watch games. We had it be about killing Zombies to stick with the Decay theme while having an extra bit of "decay" by having it be an older system.</p>

                <p>We wanted to have it feel as much like you're playing an original system as possible, which led us to the dilemma of how we should approach the PC experience, as allowing the player to use the keyboard may be more comfortable to play the game, but would ultimately detract from the experience of "using" the system. Ultimately, given the simple nature of the game itself and the novelty of the system, we felt the experience was the most critical part of the game, so we did not allow keyboard controls to keep the on-screen buttons mandatory and encouraged the player to play on mobile to maintain the experience while having comfortable controls.</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>The project turned out very cute. It didn't make any grand placements in the Jam rankings, but those who played it had fun and many considered it nostalgic. The main critique is the lack of keyboard controls (which I could ultimately patch, though I'll maintain that I'd rather not provide that option to the players. I think it'd take away from the experience too much, and the reward just wouldn't be worth it from how simple the game would now be with the precision and accuracy of a keyboard).</p>

                <p>The class' jam theme was "Homage", so I wanted to see how I can make Catherine's gameplay style work in a 2D space. I realized the act of climbing became far less interesting, but I still had fun stacking blocks in the system I made, so I made that the point of the game!</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>A retelling of the Odyssey where Odysseus is now a giant ball named Balldyseus!</p>
                <p>This passion project is a turn-based strategy game where the player stops enemies from reaching their objective by launching Balldyseus into them. I usually describe it as a fusion between Billiards and Fire Emblem.</p>
                <p>It's still an unfinished demo, but I'd like to develop the concept into a fully realized game.</p>
            <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>For my Classical Mythology class, I wanted to figure out how to work the story of The Odyssey into a game for my final project. Then, I came up with the hilarious idea of Odysseus being a giant ball named "Balldyseus." Based on this, I knew I wanted some ball-like movement involved. I grew curious about working with an asymmetrical gameplay style where one player must move discretely (along a grid) while another player may move freely.</p>

                <p>As I started with the GDD, most gameplay concepts came naturally. Billiard movement made the most sense for the player, with discretely moving enemies. Since it would be weird and awkward for enemies to attack Balldyseus, I opted to go for a concept where Balldyseus has no health but is instead trying to defend a point from being reached by the enemy, and made the concept turn-based.</p>

                <p>I realized that the player only being allowed to attack provided a lack of agency for the players. They aim, fire, then can basically look away from the screen until it's their turn again. To make things more interesting, I implemented Bounce Mode as an alternative to Attack Mode, which you can switch to at any time.</p>

                <p>Bounce mode does not damage but will push an enemy back one space on collision, as well as impulsing Balldyseus back whenever he collides with an object. To prevent this from creating an infinite turn of bounces, the player can only bounce off an object five times during a turn.</p>

                <p>The player can switch between these two states anytime during a movement. This gives the player a layer of added interactivity, as they not only must choose their velocity but must stay engaged throughout the whole movement to choose when to switch modes.</p>

                <p>There is also a High-Speed state to encourage mode-switching, where if you are moving at a high speed, you deal double damage in attack mode. The idea is to get the player to build their velocity in Bounce mode, then time their mode-switch to attack the enemy with greater damage, adding a layer of reaction-timing and planning.</p>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>While displaying the game at playtesting events or conventions, it received many positive reactions and praise, which has made me determined to see the project through to a fully released product before I graduate.</p>

                <p>The overall gameplay and foundation of the project is mostly complete, and I'm currently working on making a polished demo. This involves adding various new enemy types, levels, a boss, a proper title screen, short cutscenes, UI, and audio.</p>

                <p>Once that's done, I aim to test the demo, see what needs to be changed, and then make new enemies/levels/bosses based on the rest of the Odyssey. I'm not sure when the demo or final game will be done as I must prioritize my studies, work, and personal life, but it'll always be in the works!</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>EGD is a nonprofit organization dedicated to aiding students like me in preparing for the games industry. It has been instrumental in my growth in hard skills related to development and soft skills related to teamwork, leadership, and project management.</p>
                <p>My time as a GSP student has given me invaluable lectures on the games industry, opportunities to attend numerous games events (including GDC), experience working in smaller teams on multiple game jams, and both junior and leadership roles in their mock-AAA studio, Studio Aspen.</p>

            <h3>Exploration Program</h3>
            <h5>2022-2023</h5>
                <p>The EXP Program is designed for first-year students to better understand what they want out of the games industry. EXP students were placed into small groups of four, where we worked together over a year to complete various games, letting us better grasp the game development process. We developed several tiny projects in our first semester, followed by our larger project, "Refold," for our second semester, which later won "Best GSP Game" for the program for that school year.</p>
                <p>In addition, we attended various lectures on career readiness and the games industry and took various networking trips to local games events.</p>

            <h3>Aspen Designer/Programmer</h3>
            <h5>2023-2024</h5>
                <p>For my second year at the program, I joined "Studio Aspen," EGD's mock-AAA studio where roughly fifty of the program's students must work together to make a game over the school year. The program is split up into a Design, Programming, Art, and Audio team, each with their own leads, and an Executive Producer at the helm. This year I was part of both the Design and Programming team working on "Striking Hell."</p>
                <p>Outside of this, I worked on several more game jams, including "Opossum Ops," "Chick Chase," and for Global Game Jam, "Joke's On You!" which went on to win the "Best Use of Theme" award at the NYU Game Center's GGJ event. Weekly lectures and regular game events also continued as usual throughout the year.</p>
                <p>I also participated in that year's summer program, where I worked in a small team of five on two two-day jams and one longer jam. We produced "Against The Tide!", "Pick Yourself Up!", and "Decay & Watch."</p>

            <h3>Aspen Design Producer</h3>
            <h5>2024-2025</h5>
                <p>This year's Aspen team is nearing one hundred members, making it one of the largest the program has had up to this point. This year, I've been selected as the Design Producer, where I'll be leading a team of roughly twenty students to design the project.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>My time at CUNY BA thus far has been invaluable in growing my knowledge as a Game Designer, Programmer, and Software Engineer.</p>
                <p>The coursework for my degree is split between two departments. I take standard Comp-sci & Math courses at Hunter College's Computer Science Department, alongside Game Development-focused courses at CCNY under their emerging Gaming Pathways program.</p>
                <p>I am also part of Hunter's Muse Scholar Program, a scholarship cohort dedicated to artistically and academically gifted individuals.</p>

            <h3>Gaming Pathways Department (CCNY)</h3>
                <p>This emerging department is growing to provide a Digital Game Development Major to the CUNY system. It's run by Nicholas Fortugno, an incredibly talented game designer & teacher, alongside many other skillful members of its growing staff.</p>
                <p>I've taken numerous courses here that have significantly advanced my skills as a developer. Courses like Game Design taught me bigger-picture ideation, Level Design taught me detail-oriented designing within constraints, UX/UI gave me an understanding of Figma and market research, and Game Programming 1-3 helped me learn Unity and practice rapid prototyping.</p>

            <h3>Computer Science Department (Hunter)</h3>
                <p>Outside of Game Development, I'm taking more traditional Comp-sci coursework at Hunter College. This includes several SWE courses focused on Python and C++ alongside Math courses like Calculus & Discrete Structures.</p>

            <h3>Muse Scholar Program (Hunter)</h3>
                <p>As part of this program, I spent my first two semesters at Hunter taking a two-part Explorations in the Arts class. This class granted me extended knowledge of various art forms and allowed me to experience them first-hand on regular in-person trips. This may seem fairly disconnected from my career track, but the knowledge I've gained here has deeply helped me view game development as the art form it is and treat it as such in my projects.</p>
